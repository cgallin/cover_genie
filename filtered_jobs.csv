We are a Montreal-based agency specializing in image management, marketing, and communication. With a proven track record of transforming brands and businesses. Our mission is to help businesses enhance their visibility, reputation, and customer engagement through cutting-edge branding, strategic marketing, and tailored communication services.

Whether it’s through social media management, SEO strategies, or full-service branding, we offer comprehensive solutions that help businesses stand out in an increasingly competitive landscape.

The Role:

We’re seeking a passionate and self-driven Freelance business development representative to join our growing team. This is more than just a sales role—it’s an opportunity to build a career on your own terms, leveraging your network and communication skills to make a tangible difference for businesses while creating a reliable stream of passive income for yourself.

As a representative, your mission will be to connect with local businesses, stores, and offices in your area that struggle with ineffective communication, poor branding, or weak marketing strategies. You’ll introduce them to our innovative service packages, designed to revitalize their image, boost their marketing impact, and drive customer engagement.

What We Offer:
• Total Freedom and Autonomy: You set your own hours, work where you want, and run your business your way.
• Passive Income Potential: Our subscription-based service packages allow you to build a steady, recurring revenue stream. With enough effort, you could stop working while continuing to earn income month after month.
• No Degree or Prior Experience Required: Success in this role depends on your motivation, ambition, and communication skills—not your resume.
• Supportive Team: While you’re independent, you’re never alone. Our agency provides all the tools, resources, and support you need to succeed.

Key Responsibilities:
• Identify businesses in your area with underwhelming marketing, branding, or communication strategies.
• Professionally present and explain our comprehensive service packages and their value to these businesses.
• Build trust and long-term relationships with clients, helping them see the benefits of partnering with our agency.
• Meet and exceed sales targets to grow your portfolio and build a foundation for passive income.

Who You Are:
• Highly Motivated: You’re hungry for success and ready to take charge of your career.
• Exceptional Communicator: You have a natural talent for connecting with people and presenting ideas clearly and confidently.
• Goal-Oriented: You thrive on challenges and are determined to achieve your objectives.
• Entrepreneurial Spirit: You see the value in creating your own opportunities and taking control of your future.

Why This Opportunity Is Different:

This isn’t a typical 9-to-5 sales job. It’s a chance to create real financial freedom through effort, strategy, and relationship-building. As you onboard clients, you’re not just earning a one-time commission—you’re creating a passive income stream that will pay off month after month, year after year.

You’ll be empowered to operate independently, but you’ll also benefit from the guidance and expertise of an agency that’s dedicated to your success. This is your opportunity to make a real impact, both for yourself and for the businesses you help.

Nous croyons qu'aucune autre organisation de conseil en gestion ne s'est concentrée aussi attentivement à la compréhension de la concurrence en affaires et à aider les entreprises à effectuer les changements nécessaires pour réussir sur des marchés de plus en plus compétitifs.

Recursion is revolutionizing the drug discovery process by combining automated assaying of cell biology, diverse data sets, and advanced analytics.

You will be working alongside a team of Machine Learning Research Scientists and you will be involved in developing new learning algorithms that help us efficiently discover new biological and chemical relationships.

In this role, you will:
• Interrogate different data modalities (including morphological and transcriptomic assays)—characterizing their strengths, weaknesses, caveats and information content
• Implement, train and optimize deep learning models for jointly embedding this multi-modal data
• Quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate multi-modal models and embeddings
• Collaborate with other ML researchers to more fully utilize Recursion’s growing data universe and thereby expand the applicability and utility of our maps of biology.

Recursion is passionate about open science, so you will be encouraged to work towards publishing any interesting results at the top machine learning conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, etc.). Join us at Recursion and be part of a team that is reimagining drug discovery through cutting-edge technology and machine learning.

Location:

This position is based at our offices in Montreal, housed at Mila - Quebec AI Institute, the largest AI institute in the world. We prefer in-person collaboration, but will consider remote work for this position.

The Team You’ll Join

You will be joining the Machine Learning Research team in Montreal. This team works on developing the next generation of machine learning approaches for drug discovery. You’ll work cross-functionally with machine learning scientists and engineers as well as topic experts who are invested in the creation of data or application of models to accomplish Recursion’s mission.

The Experience You’ll Need
• Currently enrolled in or recent graduate from a Masters or PhD program in Computer Science or related quantitative field
• Relevant experience as a researcher, including internships, full-time, or at a lab
• Experience contributing research to machine learning communities, including publishing papers in major conferences or journals (e.g. ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, CVPR, ICCV and associated workshops)
• Outstanding past projects, publications, and presentations, and a demonstrated ability to communicate results
• Experience using modern technologies to accelerate machine learning (e.g. PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras, Horovod, etc)
• Experience with cellular images, biological sequence data, or any form of gene expression data (e.g. RNAseq, scRNAseq, L1000, etc…) is a plus
• Experience with multi-modal models or generative models is a plus

How You’ll be Supported

You’ll work closely with our Research Scientists, with regular 1:1s that provide opportunities for support and feedback, and a collaborative work environment.

The Values That We Hope You Share:
• We Care: We care about our drug candidates, our Recursionauts, their families, each other, our communities, the patients we aim to serve and their loved ones. We also care about our work.
• We Learn: Learning from the diverse perspectives of our fellow Recursionauts, and from failure, is an essential part of how we make progress.
• We Deliver: We are unapologetic that our expectations for delivery are extraordinarily high. There is urgency to our existence: we sprint at maximum engagement, making time and space to recover.
• Act Boldly with Integrity: No company changes the world or reinvents an industry without being bold. It must be balanced; not by timidity, but by doing the right thing even when no one is looking.
• We are One Recursion: We operate with a 'company first, team second' mentality. Our success comes from working as one interdisciplinary team.
