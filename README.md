## This app generates cover letters written by ChatGPT through the OpenAI API.
   + A data set of current job postings in several Canadian cites was generated through [Jobs API](https://rapidapi.com/Pat92/api/jobs-api14)
   + A [DistilBERT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/distilbert) NLP model was trained on a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshkon/linkedin-job-postings) to classify job postings into the top 11 industries.
   + The classifier model was used to classify and filter the jobs scraped by Jobs API.
   + The user's CV (in .pdf format) is uploaded and they choose a job title, location and preferred industries.
   + Using cosine similarity the filtered job postings are narrowed down to five by relevance to the uploaded CV.
   + Cover letters for the top 5 jobs are then generated by an [OpenAI GPT model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) through OpenAI's API.

## The Data 
To gather online job postings we used the [Jobs API](https://rapidapi.com/Pat92/api/jobs-api14) service which scrapes job postings from postings on Google Jobs. The data included the company name, job description (text describing the job, its requirements, and other company information), job title, the date it was posted,location,and a url link to the posting. We would call on the API every day for several canadian cities and stored the data on a CSV file. At the launch of the app we had ~ 30,000 job postings in our data frame. 

## DistilBERT Classifier 
The first stage of filtering our job posting data set to recommend the most relevant jobs to the user was to classify each job posting into a specific industry. To filter the job postings we used a pretrained [DistilBERT](https://keras.io/keras_hub/api/models/distil_bert/distil_bert_text_classifier_preprocessor/#distilberttextclassifierpreprocessor-class) text classifier. The model was trained on a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshkon/linkedin-job-postings) of 160,000+ job postings scraped from LinkedIn in 2023-2024. The dataset included the job descriptions aswell as the industry associated with each posting, so it was ideal for training a language classification model for the job descriptions. Some feature engineering was required before the model was trained; there were intially over 400 unique job industries
